## Web Tools

### [Flash Player Check](https://n0samu.github.io/flash-player-check)
Test whether your Flash plugin (or Flash emulator extension) is working and displaying Flash content.

### [Ruffle Saves Exporter](https://n0samu.github.io/ruffleSavesExport)
A bookmarklet that exports the save data of web builds of Ruffle in .SOL format, suitable for use with the Ruffle desktop player or Adobe Flash Player.

### [Ruffle Userscript](https://n0samu.github.io/inject-ruffle.user.js)
A userscript that loads and plays Flash content on the current page with Ruffle, without a dedicated browser extension. Works best with [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/). Also works in desktop and mobile Safari with the [Userscripts app](https://github.com/quoid/userscripts#userscripts-safari).

### [Strict URL Encode and Decode](https://n0samu.github.io/strictEncodeURL)
A tool for [percent-encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) and decoding URLs and URL components. When encoding, it leaves any already-encoded parts of the string intact rather than double-encoding them. It's one easy box that "just works", unlike any of the similar tools that I've found online.
